My new laravel 4 site (describe.com)

This project is a Laravel 4 project that I've been working on but suddenly doesn't load on my browser anymore

require(C:\xampp\htdocs\describe\bootstrap/../vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream

Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required 'C:\xampp\htdocs\describe\bootstrap/../vendor/autoload.php' (include_path='.;\xampp\php\PEAR')

please anyone can help, I'll really appreciate
